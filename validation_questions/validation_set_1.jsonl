{"index": 2, "prompt": "Solve the equation \"5.9=x+5.11\"", "solution": "The solution of this equation is \"x=5.9-5.11=0.79\"", "Solver_answer": "To solve the equation $5.9 = x + 5.11$ for $x$, we want to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation.\n\nWe can do this by subtracting $5.11$ from both sides of the equation:\n$5.9 - 5.11 = x + 5.11 - 5.11$\n$5.9 - 5.11 = x$\n\nNow, we need to perform the subtraction:\n   $5.90$\n-  $5.11$\n-------\n   $0.79$\n\nSo, $x = 0.79$.\n\nTo verify the solution, substitute $x = 0.79$ back into the original equation:\n$5.9 = 0.79 + 5.11$\n$0.79 + 5.11 = 5.90$\n$5.9 = 5.9$\nThe solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is $\\\\boxed{0.79}$.","question_type": "text-only", "image": null,"human_grade":"C"}
