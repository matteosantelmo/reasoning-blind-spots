The molecules gain enough kinetic energy to move more freely, and the ice transforms into liquid water.\n*   **Water Formation:** As more heat is absorbed, more ice turns into water.\n*   **Disappearance:** Eventually, all the ice will have melted and disappeared, leaving behind a puddle or just wetness on the surface it was on.\n\nSo, in short: **it turns into liquid water.**", "question_type": "text-only", "image": null,"human_grade":"C","solver_model":"gemini-2.5-flash"}
