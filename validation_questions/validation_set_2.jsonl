{"index": 3, "prompt": "Imagine you are in a dark room. In a drawer there are 10 red socks, 10 white socks, and 10 green socks. The light comes on. How many socks do you need to take out to be sure you have at least one pair of the same color?", "solution":" The correct answer depends on the fact that the light comes on before choosing. Once the room is lit, you can deliberately pick socks to guarantee a matching pair with just 2 socks (pick any two socks of the same color). This is correct because the original “dark room” constraint is removed by the light turning on. With full visibility, you can choose two socks of the same color directly, so 2 is sufficient. A common incorrect behavior is treating it as the classic “dark room” version and answering 4 using the pigeonhole principle (one of each color plus one extra), which ignores the modified condition.", "solver_answer":"To determine the minimum number of socks you need to pull from the drawer to guarantee at least one pair of the same color, we analyze the situation using the pigeonhole principle.\nKey Observations:\n\nThe drawer contains three colors: red, white, and green.\nEach color has 10 socks, but this number is irrelevant for the logic of the problem — we're only concerned with the number of colors.\nYou are blindfolded, so you cannot see the colors of the socks you pick.\nThe goal is to ensure that at least one pair (i.e., two socks of the same color) is obtained.\nApplying the Pigeonhole Principle:\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\nHere, the containers (or \"pigeonholes\") are the three colors.\nThe items are the socks you pick.\nTo guarantee a pair, you must consider the worst-case scenario.\nIn the worst case:\nYou pick one sock of each color first — that’s three socks.\nSince there are only three colors, you could potentially get one of each color without forming a pair.\nThe fourth sock you pick must match one of the previously selected colors, thus forming a pair.\nConclusion:\n\nNo matter how you choose the socks, after picking four socks, you must have at least one pair of the same color.","question_type": "text-only", "image": null,"human_grade":"I","solver_model":"Qwen3-1.7B"}
