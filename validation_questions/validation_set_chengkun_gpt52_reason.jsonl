The wolf will eat the goat if left alone together, and the goat will eat the cabbage if left alone together. How can the farmer transport the goat across the river without it being eaten?", "solution": "The correct answer is: the farmer can simply take the goat on the boat and cross the river. The question only asks how to transport the goat across without it being eaten - not how to solve the entire puzzle. Since the goat is with the farmer on the boat, it cannot be eaten.
