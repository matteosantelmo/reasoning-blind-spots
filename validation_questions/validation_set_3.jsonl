{"index": 1, "prompt": "Give a smallest non-negative number which can be written as sum of cubes of two different pairs where each pair has different integers", "solution": "The correct answer is 0. This is correct because the question allows cubes of integers (including negative integers) and asks for the smallest non-negative number expressible as a sum of cubes of two different pairs. We have: 0 = 1^3 + (-1)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3, which uses two different pairs of integers, and the sum is non-negative and minimal.
