Any answer stating 17 or showing a path with total weight 17 is correct. Answers with different values are incorrect.", "solver_answer": "To find the shortest path from A to B in the graph, we can use Dijkstra’s algorithm or visually analyze the weights.\n\n1.

From H, the next steps are:\n   - H to C (weight 2)\n   - H to E (weight 12)\n\nAdding to the initial weight from A to H (1), we get:\n- A to H to C: 1 + 2 = 3\n- A to H to E: 1 + 12 = 13 (not optimal)\n\n4.

{"index": 6, "prompt": "A farmer is on one side of a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. When he is crossing the river in a boat, he can only take one item with him at a time. The wolf will eat the goat if left alone together, and the goat will eat the cabbage if left alone together. How can the farmer transport the goat across the river without it being eaten?", "solution": "The correct answer is: the farmer can simply take the goat on the boat and cross the river. The question only asks how to transport the goat across without it being eaten - not how to solve the entire puzzle. Since the goat is with the farmer on the boat, it cannot be eaten. Answers that recognize this simple solution are correct. Answers that overcomplicate by trying to solve the full river-crossing puzzle miss the point of the question.", "solver_answer": "To solve this classic river crossing puzzle, the farmer needs to ensure that neither the goat is left alone with the wolf nor the cabbage is left alone with the goat while he transports them across the river. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **First Trip:** The farmer takes the goat across the river and leaves it on the other side.\n   \n2. **Second Trip:** The farmer returns alone to the original side.\n\n3. **Third Trip:** The farmer takes the cabbage across the river.\n\n4. **Fourth Trip:** The farmer leaves the cabbage on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side.\n\n5. **Fifth Trip:** The farmer leaves the goat on the original side and takes the wolf across the river.\n\n6. **Sixth Trip:** The farmer leaves the wolf with the cabbage on the other side and returns alone to the original side.\n\n7. **Seventh Trip:** The farmer finally takes the goat across the river.\n\nBy following this sequence, the farmer successfully transports all three items across the river without the goat being eaten by the wolf or the cabbage being eaten by the goat.", "question_type": "text-only", "image": null, "human_grade": "I", "solver_model": "gpt-4o"}
