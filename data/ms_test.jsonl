{"index": 2, "prompt": "Generate the next numbers of this read-aloud series: \n- 1\n- 11\n- 31\n- 1341\n", "solution": "This read-aloud series is a variation on the look-and-say sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence), where instead looking-and-saying the last term in the sequence, you code the counts of each digit in the _whole sequence_. It is important to make sure to not mistake the input series with one from the regular look-and-say sequence, as the input series doesn't follow the rules of that.\n\nBased on the rules of this Look-and-Say variation, the next numbers in the series are generated by counting the frequency of every digit that has appeared in the entire sequence so far, and then coding those counts. Based on the provided example (1,11,31,1341), the sorting order for the digit groups is descending by digit value (since in 1341, the description for the digit 3 comes before the description for the digit 1).\u2028Given this, the correct next value of the series is \u201c142361\u201d as the digit counts for the sequence 1,11,31,1341 is: One \u201c4\u201d, Two \u201c3\u201ds, and Six \u201c1\u201ds.\n\nAdding this we have 1,11,31,1341,142361. This makes the next value: \u201c1624331281\u201d as the digit counts of the updated series are: One \u201c6\u201d, Two \u201c4\u201ds, Three \u201c3\u201ds, One \u201c2\u201d, and Eight \u201c1\u201ds.\n", "question_type": "text-only", "image": null}

{"index": 4, "prompt": "Alice is supposed to meet Bob at 18:00. She wakes up from her afternoon nap, looks at her watch, which seems to say it's already 22:55, and panics for a minute. She then realises something and calms down. Why?", "solution": "Alice realized that her watch was upside down.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why she panicked and why she calmed down:\n* The Watch Type: Alice is wearing an analog watch (one with hands), not a digital one.\n* The Real Time: It was actually 17:25 (5:25 PM). At this time, both the hour hand and minute hand are pointing roughly towards the number 5 (bottom right of the watch face).\n* The Mistake: Because she was groggy from her nap, she looked at her watch upside down. When the \"5\" position is flipped 180 degrees, it sits in the \"11\" position (top left).\n* The Illusion: Hands pointing at the 11 look like the time is 22:55 (10:55 PM).\n\nThe Result: she initially panicked thinking she was nearly 5 hours late. Once she realized the orientation was wrong, she saw it was only 17:25, meaning she still had 35 minutes to get to her 18:00 meeting.", "question_type": "text-only", "image": null}

One might get tricked to think that the answer must be the implicit country completing the cycle, but looking carefully at the question it\u2019s simple to realize that the answer is in the question itself: as the question states that Norway is on the left border of Sweden, then it directly follows that Sweden is on the right border of Norway.", "question_type": "text-only", "image": null}
