{"index": "matteo-2", "prompt": "Generate the next numbers of this read-aloud series: \n- 1\n- 11\n- 31\n- 1341\n", "solution": "This read-aloud series is a variation on the look-and-say sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence), where instead looking-and-saying the last term in the sequence, you code the counts of each digit in the _whole sequence_. It is important to make sure to not mistake the input series with one from the regular look-and-say sequence, as the input series doesn't follow the rules of that.\n\nBased on the rules of this Look-and-Say variation, the next numbers in the series are generated by counting the frequency of every digit that has appeared in the entire sequence so far, and then coding those counts. Based on the provided example (1,11,31,1341), the sorting order for the digit groups is descending by digit value (since in 1341, the description for the digit 3 comes before the description for the digit 1).Given this, the correct next value of the series is “142361” as the digit counts for the sequence 1,11,31,1341 is: One “4”, Two “3”s, and Six “1”s.\n\nAdding this we have 1,11,31,1341,142361.

The variation asks instead for an object devoid of holes. The answerer might be misleaded by this variation and respond with the answer to the more famous original question.
