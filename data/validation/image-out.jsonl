{"index": 1, "prompt": "Generate a picture of bird on a ball flipped upside down.", "solution": "The correct answer should be an image showing a bird flipped upside down under a ball, with the ball on top and the bird reversed (head at the bottom, feet at the top).\nA common incorrect behavior is generating an image where the object on top is not a ball (e.g., a rock), or where the bird is not actually flipped upside down (head up, feet down).", "solver_answer":"data/validation/images/image_1_validate.png","question_type": "text-to-image","human_grade":"I","solver_model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"}

{"index": 6, "prompt": "Generate an image of a fully furnished living room. No furniture can touch the carpet. please make sure there is no furnature touching the carpet.", "solution": "The correct output is a fully furnished living room that includes multiple pieces of furniture (e.g., sofa, chairs, table, shelves), and none of the furniture may touch the carpet. All furniture must be placed entirely off the carpet (e.g., on bare floor) with a visible gap between furniture and carpet.\nThis is correct because the instruction requires a furnished living room while imposing a strict spatial constraint: the carpet must remain completely free of furniture contact. Any furniture placed on the carpet, even partially, violates the constraint and is incorrect.\nA common incorrect behavior is placing some furniture (often a sofa or coffee table) on the carpet while keeping others off it, or making the contact ambiguous due to perspective or occlusion. Another incrorrect behavior is missing some important furnitures like sofa or table, which does not satisfy the fully furnished living room requirement.","solver_solution":"data/validation/images/imagegen_6.png","question_type": "text-to-image",  "human_grade":"I","solver_model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"}
